What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


At first, I was confused about translating the procedural program to OOP. With the TAs' help, I figured out the attributes and methods for the ResaleShop and Computer class. I then encountered a problem of not being able to print out the details of the computer by trying to print out the inventory. I then realized that I would have to access those details from the computer instead of the shop. 

I would advise students taking this course in the future to start early on this assignment and go to TA and office hours if they have any questions.
